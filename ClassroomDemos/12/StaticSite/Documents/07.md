## User Authentication

In order to do certain operations in a secure way our application must be able
to identify specific users within our app.  This is called "User Authentication"
and Django provides extensive support for the process of authentication.

All users will start by registering to use the application.  This will create
specific login credentials for each user.  Our app will have a registration
page that contains a form from collecting the user name and desired password.

Built in logic validates the user name and password to ensure that they are
both allowed by the rules of the system.


## Password Encryption

It is critical to security that passwords are always encrypted.  This includes
when the information is collected by the form, sent to the server, and stored
on the remote server.

Passwords are hashed and the hash key is stored in the database.  When the
user reenters the password it is rehashed and compared to the stored value.
This protects the password in its raw form.  It is impossible to calculate or
lookup the actual password, but the system guarantees to verify that the user
attempting to login has entered the matching password from registration.

This requires some tricky code that you never want to write.  The primary goal 
is to have a robust implementation that you can trust.  The cryptography built
into Django has the highest level of security available.


## User Object

Django provides a data model that is at the heart of the user authentication
scheme.   When you create an new application, Django automatically produces 
the code for user authentication.   When you do your first database migration
it creates all the tables that are required.

    $ python manage.py migrate

You can immediately begin creating users and ensuring that all users must have
permissions to access the system.


## Author Objects

Django provides all of the code needed to get a user ID and credentials that
will let users login.  Now we will extend this basic user ID to add other 
information that is specific to our application.  The typical web application
has user accounts that correspond to the user IDs for login. There is usually
a profile for each user.

For this discussion, we will create a data model for an Author.  This record
will be created when a new User is registered.  The only information that is
required to register a new Django user is the "username" and "password". This
information is captured by the Django code inside the UserCreationForm.

When the user first logs in they are shown the settings of their profile which
contain other info that we wish to collect.  This allows us to draw a clear
separation between the secure info stored in the User record and the application
specific information stored in the Author record.

Each time an author is logged in we are able to see the User and Author
information that matches.  This data is used to make decisions about what
each user can do in the application.


## User Authorization

Authentication guarantees the identity of each user.  Authorization determines
what permissions the user is allowed to have.  Authentication is a prerequisite
to restricting access. 

We can limit access to every page on our system.  Some users may be permitted
to view or the modify a specific page.  The tools make it easy to limit access
in any way that seems appropriate.
