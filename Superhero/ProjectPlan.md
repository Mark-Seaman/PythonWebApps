Past Work,
    New skilled I learned was a better understanding of how Visual Studio, Digital Ocean, and Github communicate to get a single applicaion running. The intracate was they are linked and how a single syntax error can set you back hours.
    A few design patterns I began to notice was the way that an application must be created and how important URL's are to having each section communicating properly.
    I did have a few loose ends to resolve and could have managed my time better to have better taken advantave of the knolwedge this class has to offer.

Future Work,
    Skills I need to learn are a better undrsstaning of commands and how I can manipulate code to better understand what files and proccesses I can preform in a terminal.
    My biggest challanges are going to be balancing work/school/and life. I understand that I should look for  assistance when it is nessesary and easily offered to me. In my case asking for help could have changed my outcome of understaing in this class.


Mark, 
    I would like to thank you for this course and the help you have extended to me. I was able to get code on Project 5,6, and 7 up and running on my end. I went through and looked how each aspect of those projects reflected the lectures and how they applied to the resposotory you shared with us.
