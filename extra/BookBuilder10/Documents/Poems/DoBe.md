# To DO and To BE

by Mark Seaman

---

I often define myself by what I DO

- My career
- My accomplishments
- My goals
- My contributions
- My influence
- My position
- My money
- My productivity

I seldom define myself by who I AM

- My character
- My peaceful mind
- My capacity to love
- My relationships
- My resiliency
- My understanding
- My growth

There is an ultimate debate between "to DO" or "to BE".

While both are important one is supreme.

Accomplishment without character is pointless.

Character without accomplishment will mend itself.

Integrity of soul is when all parts work together.

Only then can I BE the person I want to BE.

Only then can I DO the things that I am destined to DO.
