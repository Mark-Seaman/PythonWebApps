by Mark Seaman

I don't believe in science.   

I don't believe in religion.

I don't believe in government.

I don't believe in poverty.

I don't believe in immigration.

I don't believe in healthcare.

I don't believe in education.

I don't believe in climate change.

I don't believe in people.

I don't believe in truth.

I believe in  Twitter and Facebook and talk radio.

I believe in  Fake News and Conspiracies.

I believe in  learning about the true story they don't want you to know.  

I believe in  listening to exciting insights from celebrities.

I believe in  building my own sense of truth and justice.

Welcome to modern America, where we each make our own reality.
