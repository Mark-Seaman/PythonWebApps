# Generation Gap

by Mark Seaman

---

Every life stage has its own world view,  its own wisdom, its own truth, its own idiocy.

Between the life stages there is a fundamental gap of understanding.

You can't walk in my shoes because they don't fit you!

Mind the gap.

## 20-60 gap

- Old people ...
    - just want to control me
    - live in fear
    - don't even care what I want
    - take away my freedom
    - just care about healthcare and taxes
    - hoard money
    - are self-righteous

## 60-20 gap

- Young people ...
    - out of control
    - have no fear 
    - don't even care what I want
    - are dangerous and foolish
    - just care about themselves
    - want my money
    - are self-righteous
