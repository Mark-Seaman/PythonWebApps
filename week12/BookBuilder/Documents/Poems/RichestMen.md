# Richest of Men

by Mark Seaman

---


The world has always had its kings and emperors.

There are some men that are slightly poorer than God,
a little lower than the angels.

These men embody the true spirit of humanity.

They rule vast empires and control the lives of billions.

The kings of this earth rule with dollar, gold, and bitcoin.

Their wealth is greater than nations.

As a young man I dreamed of being in that world, but now I see it in a different light.

Gates, Musk, Bezos, Zuck - the kings of our age, kings of this world.

The Great American Dream taken to extreme.

Wealth and Power - wealth creates power, power protects wealth.

The cycle is repeat until death when a new king will emerge to take his place.

There will always be a High King, but the road to the top of the world is not paved with generosity.

Each of these kings has changed the world in profound ways - sometimes for the better.

Every day my life is deeply affected by their work, their products, their philosophy, their greed.

Each of them touch the lives of billions, and for many in profound ways.

I cannot speak to their inner life or character, but I do know that with great power comes great responsibility.

The four kings, all Americans, control more wealth than nations.  This must be a heavy load.

What does it profit if you gain the world but lose your soul?

I pray for these men ... that they would not be crushed under the weight.
