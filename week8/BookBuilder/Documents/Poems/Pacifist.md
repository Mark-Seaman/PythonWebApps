# The Pacifist

As a staunch pacifist I have been wrestling with the idea of when it is OK to
kill.

The Ten Commandments say "Thou shalt not kill".  But when we study the ancient
Hebrew this is more like, "You should not murder".   Is there a difference?

Every religion has a taboo about killing, but we need to be more specific about
precisely falls under the restriction.   I've built this helpful guide to
clarify the rules of murder. so that you can make an informed choice.


10 Rules for Qualified Pacifism


1. It is not murder, if you are defending the lives of the weak and defenseless 
or yourself. This is called **Protection**.
2. It is not murder, when you protect the property of the rich (with net worth at least
$1,000,000).  This is **Justice**.
3. It is not murder, when you kill the unborn, or elderly who are disabled.  
This is **Mercy**.
4. It is not murder, when religious leaders say it is necessary.  Killing Arabs 
and Jews is always permitted based on you religion.  This is being **Faithful**.
5. It is not murder, when you act on behalf of a duly appointed government.  
This is **Heroism**.
6. It is not murder, when you carry a gun and badge. This is **Public Service**.
7. It is not murder, when the government is behaving in a way that impinges 
your personal freedom.  This is **Patriotism**.
8. Is is not murder, when the deceased did or said something that upset you. 
This is **Avenging**.
9. It is not murder, when you kill those who will never have a high quality of 
life: poor, minorities, drug dealers, prostitutes, and LGBT.  This is **Pruning**.
10. It is not murder, if you don't get caught or if you can establish reasonable 
doubt.  This is a **Righteous Kill**.
